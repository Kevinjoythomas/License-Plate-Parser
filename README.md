## License Plate Parser 

# This is a License Plate Parser model designed to accurately read and interpret characters on vehicle license plates using object detection based on YOLOv5.


#### üõ£Ô∏è License Plate Detection Using YOLOv5:
Utilizing advanced object detection techniques, this model can accurately identify and localize license plates from images or video frames.

#### üî§ Character Recognition and Sorting:
Once the license plate is detected, each character is identified and sorted using a specialized algorithm to ensure the correct sequence. This includes:

- **Character Detection**: YOLOv5 detects individual characters on the license plate.
- **Character Sorting Algorithm**: A custom sorting algorithm processes the detected characters, ensuring they are in the correct order for accurate reading.
